# Demand Summary (Time Slicing Sub Routine) - RTS Toolbox

# - Sub routine is executed at the end of Time Slicing.
# - If multiple DemandSummary_*.yaml exist, table names
#   must not be identical across yaml configurations.
# - Please refer to TimeSlice-segment_disagg_demand
#   within TimeSlicing.yaml for available segments.

STEPS:
    - DemandSummary

DemandSummary:
    # steps to export demand summaries, method of summary is always sum of trips
    export_demand_steps:
        # name of step will be used as table or file name
        RTS_Demand:
            # result data type: 
            #     data_table - long data table with segments
            #     matrix - named array/column with full OD
            type: matrix
            # data export format: 
            #     ['sql', # trip_summaries sqlite db
            #      'csv', # comma separated
            #      'fea', # feather file
            #      'emx'] # emme matrix output (matrix only)
            export_format: ['fea']
            # group data by columns:
            #     should match segment_disaggregation naming
            #     variable not specified in group by will be summed
            #     mat_type (for TOD/Daily) should always be included
            group_by: [mat_type, purpose, income, assign_mode, vot]
            # filter segment:
            filter_by:
                mat_type: ['DPA']
                pr_dr: ['PR']
