In some cases this means foroging features that have been recently introduced or having code that is not compatible with python installations outside EMME. However, it ensures that the RTM will run without further configuration providing the user has installed the correct version of EMME. Python + util \u00b6 The RTM scripting employs a utility toolbox that creates functions for repeated operations. It is worth familiarizing yourself with the functions here as they are often employed outside the RTM run itself to post-process data. For example, util can be used to create a pandas dataframe for full matrices and append RTM matrices to it for futher analysis or plotting in python. util = _m.Modeller().tool(\"translink.util\") df = util.get_pd_ij_df(eb) # create a longform pandas dataframe for full matrices # add columns for light and heavy truck OD tables to the data frame df['amLGVDemand'] = util.get_matrix_numpy(eb, \"mfLGVAM\").flatten() df['amHGVDemand'] = util.get_matrix_numpy(eb, \"mfHGVAM\").flatten() In the above example matrix names or numbers can be used to access the data. Data extraction using variables of interest tool \u00b6 In this example we use a spreadsheet to build a sqlite database. This tools allows the user to create tables and fields within a table using EMME matrix calculations. The Variables_of_Interest.xlsx spreadsheet is located in the RTM/Scripts/Phase3Analytics folder. Setting up the spreadsheet \u00b6 The Datamap tab describes what each field does in the Sheet1 tab. The Sheet1 tab is used to build the database. A simple matrix calculation can be used to extract data. Entering the following in Sheet1 will create a table in the output sqlite database with AM demand for light and heavy goods vehicles equivalent to the pandas data frame example above: In addtion to simple data extraction, new data can be generated based on RTM outputs using EMME matrix calculator expressions. For example, we can create a matrix of the minimum time on transit between all zones considering both the bus and rail modes. Note that we can reference EMME matrices by name or number. Warning All Attributes (fields) associated with the same Category (table) must be of the same dimension. For example, full matrices (MF) and vectors (MO/MD) must be placed in separate tables. Running the Modeller Tool \u00b6 Once you have specified the data you wish to output in in Sheet1 , the modeller tool Variables of Interest Extraction located in the Phase3Analytics Toolbox can be run to produce the outputs. To create the database with your specified tables and fields simply run the tool with the appropriate sheet name in the field. If you have not changed the name from Sheet1 there is nothing to update and you can simply run the tool. Note The name Sheet1 can be changed to any Excel allowable name. The chosen name just needs to be passed to the tool either in the modeller interface or the function call. Viewing results \u00b6 The requested results will be output to a sqlite database named Variables_of_Interest_Results.db . The output can be viewed in the same manner as the trip_summaries.db and rtm.db discussed here [data_outputs/#using-the-rtm-and-trip-summaries-databases]","title":"Model Data Analysis"},{"location":"data_analysis/#model-data-analysis","text":"","title":"Model Data Analysis"},{"location":"data_analysis/#python-libraries-and-the-emme-python","text":"In general the RTM uses the default python libraries installed with the EMME python.

Requirements \u00b6 We encourage all users and developers to be familiar with EMME as well as the RTM development stack: python , SQL and git . If you are new to EMME, we recommend you to take EMME Training Courses . If you are new to programming, you should go through some online tutorials and documentations for python , SQL and git before proceeding. Licensed installation of EMME Desktop 4.4.2 Installation of git Installation of git lfs Installation of SQLite Studio Installation of Visual Studio Code (optional) Note A valid EMME license is required to run the RTM. See Contributing if you need help obtaining a license or need access to the RTM. Cloning the Model \u00b6 To get the latest version of the rtm, clone it from the RTM github repository. The following bash commands will clone the repository from the master branch, and fetch the latest commit with large file storage support. Then, it will checkout the current branch into a new branch named master_working_01 . We recommend that you rename the new branch based on the project you are working on: git clone https://github.com/TransLinkForecasting/rtm.git --branch master --single-branch cd rtm/ git fetch --all git lfs install git lfs pull git checkout -b 'master_working_01' To clone a specific official release, replace master with a version tag such as RTM3.3 . If this is the first time you use git, you might need to set your name and email for git commits, see Git Setup . Update File References \u00b6 EMME toolbox stores absolute paths and they need to be updated when the model has been copied or moved to a new directory. Please also run the following after you clone the model: cd 'RTM/Scripts/' bash 'relocate_tools.sh' Alternatively, you can run the batch file RTM\\Scripts\\relocate_tools.bat on Windows. Folder Structure \u00b6 The RTM is delivered as a collection of input files in the BaseNetworks/ folder with a collection of python scripts in Scripts/ folder. The EMME project file RTM.emp reference all required folders and is loaded with a Minimal Base Databank stored in Template/ folder. Before running the model, familiarize yourself with the model folder structure.

Initialize Databank \u00b6 You can initialize a single databank using the EMME Modeler or initialize multiple databanks using EMME Notebook, depending on your need. To start the EMME, open the file. This will launch EMME, open the Minimal Base Databank's Placeholder Scenario when prompted. With EMME Modeler \u00b6 To open Modeler, click on the EMME Modeler icon . Once the Modeler opens, find Translink RTM Phase 3 Model toolbox and open the Initialize Emmebank tool: Enter a folder name and a name for the databank. Try to be descriptive. For example, if this is a databank for editing or debugging network only, name it network_edit_something , if this is a final copy of a new business as usual run for year 2050, name it 00_BAU_2050 . Once you enter the names, click > Run . Once the run is completed, the Tool complete message will appear. With EMME Notebook \u00b6 If you are comfortable with python and Jupyter Notebook, we strongly recommend that you use EMME Notebook to initialize databanks. This improves the reproducibility of your model run. This is generally not needed for network scenario or testing, but for final copy of a run, it is highly recommend. To open EMME Notebook, click on the EMME Notebook icon . The EMME Notebook should open in your browser, if it didn't open automatically, look for http://localhost:xxxx/ in the EMME - Notebook command prompt window. The default is usually http://localhost:8888/ . Once opened, you should see a list of folders in the Scripts/ folder. Go to Tools/ folder and make a duplicate of init_many.ipynb , name it to something more descriptive for your use, like init_many_00_BAU_2050.ipynb , then open it. Modify params as needed, run the entire script to initialize the databank. Build Scenario \u00b6 There are a wide range of changes you can make to the EMME base model for your study. We won't be able to cover them all in detail here, but here are some examples of model changes: demographics new roads or bridges new transit lines new transit stops transit fare tolls mobility pricing park and ride pricing etc... Network editing \u00b6 The EMME Network Editor provides users the ability to create and modify nodes, links, turns, transit lines, and transit segments. We will use a BRT line example to illustrate how to add modes and vehicles for the RTM, and edit networks in EMME. Custom Inputs \u00b6 There are a number of custom inputs that the RTM uses at model initialization and run time to modify model behavior: Custom files demographic and geographic transit vehicles and modes Custom data Scalars: custom_scalars.csv Network: custom_network.txt Attribute: custom_attributes.txt Transit Segment: custom_tseg.txt Example: 2050 BRT Line \u00b6 Similar to most model application exercises, in our example, there are two main components of changes we are making to the 2050 base model: network editing and model custom inputs. Network editing - adding a new transit line Custom inputs Add congestion pricing to the network with custom_network.txt input file Use a custom demographic file for corridor intensification Step 1: create new scenarios \u00b6 Duplicate the base scenario input files, and rename them with a new scenario number. For example, if you are making changes on top of scenario \"5000\", name it \"5001\", \"5002\". Once you added all the scenarios, add these new scenario numbers into the InitEmmebank.py script. This will allow the initialize emmebank modeler tool to load the new scenarios. Step 2: add new modes \u00b6 Before we create a new transit line, we need to make sure the mode and the vehicle of is available, add the new mode to modes.in file in the base network folder: Then check the tvehicles.in file in the base network folder: Note After the modes are added, it won't be available in the already initialized databank and scenario. You should re-initialize a working copy of the databank. Now, you will need to initialize a new databank with the new scenario number, mode, and vehicle. You can give it a descriptive and abbreviated name such as 01_Lg_BRT_CP_LU_2050 . Step 3: perform network editing \u00b6 Open EMME network editor , add notes, links, and transit line as needed. Make sure you save a copy of the build file before you save and exit the scenario. Build files can be created from any changes you made while in the Network Editor. The build file is a great way to save and replicate model network changes. If you have a build file, you can stage it and run the changes. * Copy your build file to Network_builds/ folder. * Open \"Network History and Builds\" prompt from EMME Network Editor . Click the folder icon to \"Add network builds\", then click \"Stage\". * Preview the build, then run the build: Step 4: set up custom inputs \u00b6 For the BRT example, we will use custom_network.txt and a simple 8-zone shapefile to add congestion pricing attribute to the network in batch. We will also load a custom demographic file with 20% population intensification along the study corridor. The custom input file such as custom_network.txt needs to be placed in the Input/ folder within the emme databank folder, such as the folder db_01_Lg_BRT_CP_LU_2050 or 01_Lg_BRT_CP_LU_2050 . (Do not place the file in the BaseNetworks folder!) The custom demographic file such as taz1700_demographics_2050-20.csv needs to be selected as the demographic input when running the model. Export Scenario \u00b6 While in most cases your current databank for the alternative scenario is ready to run, it is important to export your new scenario network and organize all input files into a sub folder within the Scenario_Inputs folder. This allows you to share your new scenario with other users without needing to copy the entire databank with results. This also allow you to quickly reinitialize the scenario to run on a newer version of the RTM. Export Network \u00b6 To export your scenario's network, open EMME Modeler: Then select your new scenario to export: Organize Scenario Inputs \u00b6 We highly recommend that you store every input required to rebuild your new scenario and replicate your model run within a sub folder of the Scenario_Inputs folder. For our example, this would be the folder structure for all the changes we have made in our BRT example: RTM/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 Scenario_Inputs/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 01_2050-20-hw8-cp_Lg_BRT-g/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 custom_network.txt \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 modes.in \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 tvehicles.in \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 BaseNetworks/ \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Inputs/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 taz1700_demographics_2050-20.csv \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 base_network_5001.txt \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Scripts/Phase3Scripts/ \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Tools/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502\u2500\u2500 init_many_example_lgrt.ipynb \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 run_many_example_lgrt.ipynb \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Phase3Scripts/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 InitEmmebank.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 Media/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 RTM_8ZonePolygon.shp \u2514\u2500\u2500 ... Run Model \u00b6 You can run the model using a single databank using the EMME Modeler or run multiple databanks using the EMME Notebook, depending on your need. EMME Modeler \u00b6 Once you have set up all the input files in the databank, such as customized demographics, custom input files, etc, you are ready to do a full model run using the EMME Modeler. To open Modeler, click on the EMME Modeler icon . Find Translink RTM Phase 3 Model toolbox and open the Run RTM3 tool: Change the Full Model Run settings as needed. Make sure to enter the correct model horizon year, scenario, demographic and geographic inputs. Click Run . Each model run can take 2 to 4 hours depending on the custom settings and scenario. Warning Do not interrupt the model run. The RTM model is not designed to be run in separate stages or run multiple times. If you stopped a model run before it is done, you should start over - reinitialize the databank and start run. EMME Notebook \u00b6 The EMME Notebook allows you to create .ipynb scripts that handles multiple model runs and runs with complex set up. It is ideal for our BRT example where we needed to perform link tagging and use custom network input file for congestion pricing. To open EMME Notebook, click on the EMME Notebook icon . The EMME Notebook should open in your browser, if it didn't open automatically, look for http://localhost:xxxx/ in the EMME - Notebook command prompt window. The default is usually http://localhost:8888/ . Once opened, you should see a list of folders in the Scripts/ folder. Go to Tools/ folder and make a duplicate of run_many.ipynb , name it to something more descriptive for your use, like run_many_00_BAU_2050.ipynb or run_many_example_lgrt.ipynb , then open it. Modify params as needed. Make sure you carefully review the script associated with the model run. You may need to add new code to this section depending on the requirements of your model run. Run the entire script to perform the full model run with custom settings. Commit Changes \u00b6 If this is your first time using git after an installation, see Git Setup . While working with the RTM on git, here are some ground rules: Main project branches ( master , example_brt_proj ) are always protected.
