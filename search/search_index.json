It provides long-range forecast and informs major transportation investments and policy decisions for the Metro Vancouver Regional District (MVRD). Introduction \u00b6 The RTM is a package of software that extends the functionalities of INRO EMME to model travel behaviors in the MVRD. The RTM software, written in python for EMME, handles all aspect of the four-step travel demand model: trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and network assignment. The RTM takes advantage of EMME's network editor and network assignment capability to capture user equilibrium network conditions. The latest version of the model is based on: 2011 Trip Diary and Screenline Survey ; Metro Vancouver Regional Growth Projections; and BC Provincial Digital Road Atlas .
