Introduction \u00b6 The RTM is a package of software that extends the functionalities of INRO EMME to model travel behaviors in the MVRD. The RTM software, written in python for EMME, handles all aspect of the four-step travel demand model: trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and network assignment. The RTM takes advantage of EMME's network editor and network assignment capability to capture user equilibrium network conditions. The latest version of the model is based on: 2011 Trip Diary and Screenline Survey ; Metro Vancouver Regional Growth Projections; and BC Provincial Digital Road Atlas . Get in touch \u00b6 If you require access to the RTM model, either as a user or as a developer, see about/contributing for more information.","title":"RTM"},{"location":"#rtm","text":"The Greater Vancouver Regional Travel Model (RTM) is a four-step travel demand model developed and maintained by the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority (also known as TransLink).

In some cases this means foroging features that have been recently introduced or having code that is not compatible with python installations outside EMME. However, it ensures that the RTM will run without further configuration providing the user has installed the correct version of EMME. Python + util \u00b6 The RTM scripting employs a utility toolbox that creates functions for repeated operations. It is worth familiarizing yourself with the functions here as they are often employed outside the RTM run itself to post-process data. For example, util can be used to create a pandas dataframe for full matrices and append RTM matrices to it for futher analysis or plotting in python. util = _m.Modeller().tool(\"translink.util\") df = util.get_pd_ij_df(eb) # create a longform pandas dataframe for full matrices # add columns for light and heavy truck OD tables to the data frame df['amLGVDemand'] = util.get_matrix_numpy(eb, \"mfLGVAM\").flatten() df['amHGVDemand'] = util.get_matrix_numpy(eb, \"mfHGVAM\").flatten() In the above example matrix names or numbers can be used to access the data. Data extraction using variables of interest tool \u00b6 In this example we use a spreadsheet to build a sqlite database. This tools allows the user to create tables and fields within a table using EMME matrix calculations. The Variables_of_Interest.xlsx spreadsheet is located in the RTM/Scripts/Phase3Analytics folder. Setting up the spreadsheet \u00b6 The Datamap tab describes what each field does in the Sheet1 tab. The Sheet1 tab is used to build the database. A simple matrix calculation can be used to extract data. Entering the following in Sheet1 will create a table in the output sqlite database with AM demand for light and heavy goods vehicles equivalent to the pandas data frame example above: In addtion to simple data extraction, new data can be generated based on RTM outputs using EMME matrix calculator expressions. For example, we can create a matrix of the minimum time on transit between all zones considering both the bus and rail modes. Note that we can reference EMME matrices by name or number. Warning All Attributes (fields) associated with the same Category (table) must be of the same dimension. For example, full matrices (MF) and vectors (MO/MD) must be placed in separate tables. Running the Modeller Tool \u00b6 Once you have specified the data you wish to output in in Sheet1 , the modeller tool Variables of Interest Extraction located in the Phase3Analytics Toolbox can be run to produce the outputs. To create the database with your specified tables and fields simply run the tool with the appropriate sheet name in the field. If you have not changed the name from Sheet1 there is nothing to update and you can simply run the tool. Note The name Sheet1 can be changed to any Excel allowable name. The chosen name just needs to be passed to the tool either in the modeller interface or the function call. Viewing results \u00b6 The requested results will be output to a sqlite database named Variables_of_Interest_Results.db . The output can be viewed in the same manner as the trip_summaries.db and rtm.db discussed here [data_outputs/#using-the-rtm-and-trip-summaries-databases]","title":"Model Data Analysis"},{"location":"data_analysis/#model-data-analysis","text":"","title":"Model Data Analysis"},{"location":"data_analysis/#python-libraries-and-the-emme-python","text":"In general the RTM uses the default python libraries installed with the EMME python.
